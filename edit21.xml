   ===Victor Hugo and Fyodor Dostoyevsky===

   His purpose is not ideological, however. Instead, he proposes that it is the free will to choose or reject the logical as well as the illogical that makes mankind human. He adds: "I admit that twice two makes four is an excellent thing, but if we are to give everything its due, twice two makes five is sometimes a very charming thing too."

   Dostoyevsky was writing in 1864. However, according to &lt;ahref&gt;Roderick T. Long&lt;/ahref&gt;, &lt;ahref&gt;Victor Hugo&lt;/ahref&gt; had used the phrase back in 1852. He objected to the way in which the vast majority of French voters had backed &lt;ahref&gt;Napoleon III&lt;/ahref&gt;, endorsing the way liberal values had been ignored in Napoleon III's coup.&lt;ref name="Roderick T.

   In ''Napoléon le Petit'', &lt;ahref&gt;Victor Hugo&lt;/ahref&gt; writes: "Now, get seven million five hundred thousand votes to declare that two and two make five, that the straight line is the longest road, that the whole is less than its part; get it declared by eight millions, by ten millions, by a hundred millions of votes, you will not have advanced a step." Here, Hugo is echoing earlier French thought — &lt;ahref&gt;Emmanuel Joseph Sieyès|Sieyès&lt;/ahref&gt;, in his "&lt;ahref&gt;What Is the Third Estate?&lt;/ahref&gt;" uses the phrase, "Consequently if it be claimed that under the French constitution, 200,000 individuals out of 0
