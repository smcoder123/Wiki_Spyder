   Hammond stated, on a recent edition of &lt;ahref&gt;Countdown (game show)|Countdown&lt;/ahref&gt;, that he is no longer working as a general practitioner.  Can anyone find a reliable source that confirms this?  &lt;ahref&gt;User:Skinsmoke|Skinsmoke&lt;/ahref&gt; (&lt;ahref&gt;User talk:Skinsmoke|talk&lt;/ahref&gt;) 14:59, 18 November 2012 (UTC)

   :M.D. states in ''Private Eye'' 1370 (11-24 July 2014) that he stopped general practice and is now a hospital doctor. On iwantgreatcare.org, which M.D. was recommending, [https://www.iwantgreatcare.org/doctors/dr-philip-hammond Dr Hammond describes himself] as an associate specialist in the young people's specialist Chronic Fatigue/ME service at the Royal National Hospital for Rheumatic Diseases NHS Fountation trust in Bath.  I will edit the article to reflect this. &lt;ahref&gt;User:AlmostReadytoFly|AlmostReadytoFly&lt;/ahref&gt; (&lt;ahref&gt;User talk:AlmostReadytoFly|talk&lt;/ahref&gt;) 13:52, 23 July 2014 (UTC)
